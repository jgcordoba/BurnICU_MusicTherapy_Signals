## 1. Experimental Design

### 1.1 Study Overview

This dataset forms part of an ongoing single-site Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) involving adult burn patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The key details of the study include:

- **Participants**: The study encompasses 82 adult burn patients admitted to the ICU.
- **Randomization**: Participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received standard care in addition to a maximum of six Music therapy sessions provided by a certified music therapist over a 2-week period.
- **Electrophysiological Measures**: Electrophysiological measures were taken from a subset of 9 participants in the intervention group (11%).
- **Ethics and Registration**: The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Fundaci칩n Santa Fe de Bogot치 (FSFB) with approval IDs CCEI-11234-2019 and CCEI-11971-2020. It is registered on Clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT04571255.
- **Informed Consent**: All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study.

### 1.2 Electrophysiological Measurements

- **Participants**: The electrophysiological measurements were conducted with nine adult burn patients hospitalized in the ICU of the University Hospital Fundaci칩n Santa Fe de Bogot치 (FSFB).
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Inclusion criteria involved individuals of legal adult age with an expected hospitalization period of more than 7 days. Patients with known psychiatric disorders, cognitive disabilities, sedation, or mechanical ventilation were excluded. Patients with burns in regions above the neck were also excluded.
- **Measurement Sessions**: Electrophysiological measurements were performed with each patient during two Music-Assisted Relaxation (MAR) sessions on two different days.
- **Recording Phases**: Each recording session included three phases:
  - Pre-Intervention (PRE): The resting state was measured as a baseline with the patient's eyes closed or fixed at a point.
  - MAR MTI: The specialist performed the MAR MTI.
  - Post-Intervention (POST): Measurements were taken during the patient's reincorporation after MAR.
- **Equipment**: Recordings were made with the Micromed LTM64 equipment with a sampling frequency of at least 256Hz. The Micromed LTM64 is of clinical quality and has approval from the Colombian National Institute for Drug and Food Safety (approval ID: 20090486-2015).
- **Electrode Setup**:
  - EEG: The electrode montage followed the international System 10-20. Due to time limitations, the number of electrodes was reduced to eight: FP1, FP2, T3, T4, C3, C4, O1, and O2. The reference electrode was set to Cz, and the ground electrode was placed on the mastoids.
  - ECG: ECG was acquired by a bipolar assembly of lead II with two electrodes located bilaterally in the upper part of the thorax or both arms, depending on each patient's possibilities or limitations.
  - EMG: For EMG, a bipolar electrode configuration was positioned on the left eyebrow to assess the motor activity of the corrugator supercilii muscle. The electrodes were placed with a 20 mm distance between them, following the natural alignment of the muscle fibers.

### 1.3 Pain Perception and Anxiety-Depression Levels

- **Measures**: To correlate pain, anxiety, and depression levels with electrophysiological signals, two complementary measures were obtained.
- **Pain Assessment**: A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was administered before the PRE and after the POST. The VAS ranged from 0 (indicating no pain) to 10 (representing the maximum pain possible).
- **Anxiety and Depression**: The Colombian version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used. HADS consists of two sub-scales for anxiety and depression, each containing seven items. Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale (0 to 3), with higher scores indicating increased anxiety or depression levels (maximum score of 21 for each subscale). HADS was administered after obtaining informed consent, both as a baseline and after the last music therapy sessions.
